description: On their sophomore effort Tusky, surrealist duet Robbie & Mona
  ascend beyond the lo-fi scrawlings of their debut album to something
  altogether more grandiose. Between the lights down drama of sprawling opener
  ‘Sensation’, to the ‘roll credits’ coda of closer ‘Always Gonna Be A Dead
  Man’, Tusky exists as a glitzy, lucid journey playing out before the listener.

On their sophomore effort Tusky, surrealist duet Robbie & Mona ascend beyond the lo-fi scrawlings of their debut album to something altogether more grandiose. Between the lights down drama of sprawling opener ‘Sensation’, to the ‘roll credits’ coda of closer ‘Always Gonna Be A Dead Man’, Tusky exists as a glitzy, lucid journey playing out before the listener.
