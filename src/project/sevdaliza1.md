A twisted quest through crunchy, industrial soundscapes and sugary hardstyle climaxes, ‘Victory Lap’ sees BUFFEE processing the turmoil of her final teenage years into a rich tapestry of experimental club music. 

On the EP, BUFFEE offers: "I started most of these songs when I was 19, hence the sharp swings between melodrama and hedonism. The EP explores the desire to fictionalise your experiences when on an emotional downturn, and how addictive it can be to do so."

‘Victory Lap’ offers a disorienting blend of hardstyle, glitch, electronica, industrial noise and deep-fried internet culture, owing to BUFFEE’s sixth sense for catchy melodies  and her love of compressing and clipping her samples to oblivion. All five tracks pulsate with turbulent emotion, simultaneously collapsing in on themselves while opening up new realms of hope. [Listen here](https://bfan.link/victory-lap-1).
