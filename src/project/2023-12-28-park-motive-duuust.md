title: Park Motive - Duuust
date: 2022-09-07T11:09:16.699Z
description: It is rare for a debut release to arrive with such unabashed
  intention, but Park Motive’s circuit-board symphonies have had more than
  enough incubation time. The songs on debut EP ‘Duuust’ have had various
  incarnations since Sam Herschmann’s beginnings playing underage parties in
  London in the mid 2010s, with the current six-piece line-up bringing an
  organic frenzy to his meticulous productions. Glacial layers of sound swell
  and contract around tales of characters battling their inner demons, plagued
  by the dark consequences of scientific progress and the supernatural.
