  (Co-release with Bokeh Versions)


  Slithering mutant club scenes flash with the fiercest vocals and 10 tonne bass to explore physicality, tenderness and sexuality. SPICE marks an experimentation of fusing dancehall punk, dub + hip-hop with future-facing dancefloor styles. Born out of the collective mind of some of Bristol's most twisted artists, Grove drafts in additional production credits from YOKEL (Slack Alice, Avon Terror Corps) and Robin Stewart (Giant Swan).
