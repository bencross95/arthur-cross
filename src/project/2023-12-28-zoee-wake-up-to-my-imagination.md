description: Zoee’s journey as an artist has been interesting, hidden at first
  as the anonymous vocalist from Hey QT the iconic PC music banger. She then
  released a smattering of her own singles at various iconic labels including
  Ryan Hemsworth’s Secret Songs and Vegyn’s Plz Make It Ruins, but as an artist
  was not truly out of the undergrowth. In Flaw Flower her debut album however
  we see her given a larger space to flourish and become an artist completely in
  her own right.
