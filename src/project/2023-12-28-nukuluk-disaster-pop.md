date: 2021-11-17T12:01:34.959Z
description: Nukuluk is an experimental hip-hop collective based in South
  London. Their chaotic sound draws off a series of eureka moments during studio
  play, a broad church of influence and a symbiotic relationship within the
  group. Alien field recordings, warped bass drones and clattering percussion
  create otherworldly production landscapes, stages on which vocalists Syd and
  Monika can battle it out.
