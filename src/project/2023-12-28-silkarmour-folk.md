title: Silkarmour - Folk
date: 2022-04-04T11:06:23.226Z
description: Silkarmour is an explorative musical project created by
  London-based producer and musician Enzo Samuel. Shifting aliases and formats
  over the last decade, the artist credits his obsessive, perfectionist
  tendencies as the force behind his deeply layered compositions. His latest
  track ‘Folk’ explores the fashion of anonymity and references the 2002
  documentary ‘Tokyo Noise’, wherein audience members are seemingly hypnotised
  and tormented by the intensity of a performance. The original mix of ‘Folk’ —
  a name that alludes to humanity’s ancient nature of obsession is joined by two
  edits. The first from Black Midi’s DJ Dairy and the second from MM’99.
