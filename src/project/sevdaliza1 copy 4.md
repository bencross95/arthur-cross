title: Robbie & Mona - EW
date: 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
description: Robbie & Mona is couple-duet, William Carkeet and Eleanor Gray, who
  have found a surreal creative outlet making their gorgeous scrap-book glitch
  pop with each other. Their debut album ‘EW’ experiments fearlessly with sonic
  textures and song structures, expertly toeing the line between deep emotional
  resonance and alienating disarray.
