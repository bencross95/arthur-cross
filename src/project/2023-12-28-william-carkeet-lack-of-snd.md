'Lack of SND' is a sleepy, ambient collection of improvised compositions and tape loops which engulf the listener into its space. These "songs" took shape during the autumn and winter of 2022, a period when Ellie and William lived in South London, amongst the writing and releasing of their second Robbie & Mona album “Tusky”. The collection of tracks explore the absence of sound using field recordings, unusual recording techniques, inaudible frequencies and the sounds between spoken words. William says “conceptually, I envisioned this EP as a soundtrack that would carve out a space of quiet introspection in the listener's mind—a place where they could contemplate what silence truly meant to them.” [Listen here](https://bfan.link/lack-of-snd).
