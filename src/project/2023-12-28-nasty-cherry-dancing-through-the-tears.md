title: Nasty Cherry - Dancing Through The Tears

description: Nasty Cherry emerge out of precious time spent in lockdown
  recording sessions drenched in melancholia and with a deftly crafted EP 'The
  Movie' in the palms of their hands. Throughout these five self-assured tracks
  we are led through a shattered house of mirrors where memories of past lovers
  and senses of self refract and merge. As you stumble out the exit you are left
  with a lingering sadness for what was but crucially with a sense of re-gained
  control of narrative and identity.
