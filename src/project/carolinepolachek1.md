description: In Caroline Polachek’s world, we are surrounded by fluidity,
  systems and artefacts of a modern life imbued with a beauty and rich- ness
  that represents both the dark and the light in our world. In between these
  polarities of modern life lies an artist focused on the now, inherently
  self-aware and deeply philosophical – an artist who is compelled to express
  the intense emotions in life. Her creations are sewn together by the same gold
  thread which can be traced through all historic artistic expressions of the
  human condition. Listening to her music often feels like a heavy weight
  pressing on your chest suddenly being lifted, or the sharp inhalation of cold
  air at the top of a mountain just before passing out from oxygen deprivation.
