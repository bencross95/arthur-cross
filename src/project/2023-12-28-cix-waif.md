description: Cix Shrimpton is an experimental electronic musician based in
  Catford, South-East London, who has been making music as CIX for several
  years. While taking much influence from contemporary pop music and
  deconstructed club, her music remains uncompromisingly fantastical and
  folkloric, aspiring to envelope the listener in story-telling and
  world-building musical drama.
