description: Do you ever imagine yourself passing through hardships, the
  pressures you put on yourself, structures you have become trapped within and
  breaking through to a place of calm and wisdom gained? How palpable the
  excitement within your soul would be even though you have been through so
  much? Or do you ever wish you could chat to someone who had overcome all of
  that who would tell you that everything was going to be okay on the other
  side? It feels not only has Jessie Ware been on this journey but is the person
  on the other side reaching her hand out to you, with reassurance and abundant
  joy. A person you want to meet in the smoking area of a club when you are
  feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of life to guide you through it, get you
  back on track and bring you once more into the dance! In fact you might even
  find she put the event on herself so much does she relish in bringing people
  together to shake off their troubles and feel connected.
