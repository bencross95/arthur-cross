description: Grove is a Bristol-based artist, DJ and producer. Their debut EP
  'Queer + Black' is an exploration of identity, both personal and political - a
  deft combination of sharp hooks and splintering beats beamed in from a club in
  3021 AD. It is a fierce opening statement from an artist that brings a unique
  energy to their personal experiences of sexuality, society and race, all
  within the space of 5 exhilarating tracks.
