title: Coucou Chloe - Letting Go
date: 2022-01-17T11:30:08.505Z
description: Coucou Chloe’s music often sounds like it's being played through
  speakers at a party that have already partly blown, destroyed by sub-bass. It
  creates a feeling of things being pushed to their limits. Her music demands to
  be played loud. You must obey, listen, become dominated, dominate as its
  energy channels through you, characteristic in its simultaneously restless and
  assertive full-throttle movement. This is to all be expected by an artist who
  is a founding member of Nuxxe collective alongside Sega Bodega and Shygirl.
