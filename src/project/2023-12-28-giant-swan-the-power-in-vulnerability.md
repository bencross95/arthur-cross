description: Giant Swan return with their latest EP 'Do Not Be Afraid Of
  Tenderness', a tempest of cataclysmic beats, shard-like synths and howling yet
  vulnerable vocals. Reflecting on the projects’ foundations, the Bristol techno
  duo conjure memories of “sweat, undress and inebriation” and explore a
  newfound understanding of the power in tenderness, all the while reminding us
  what we are missing by not hearing music on a fat sound system.
