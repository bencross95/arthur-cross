title: Tlya X An - TXN
date: 2024-01-01
description: Bringing a heady cocktail of hyperpop, early-2000s R&B, trap and
  deconstructed club music, Tlya X An's debut EP TXN is simply united by feeling
  so damn good. Tlya's instinctive approach to melody and production mean that
  every minor detail hits exactly where you want it to, while still feeling
  starkly new. Each ad lib and synth line hits like a drop of sherbet on your
  tongue, with her saccharine sense for melody perfectly balanced by a menacing
  sense of humor.
