title: Charles Stooke - Fine Isn't Good
date: 2023-05-10T11:11:23.274Z
description: Charles Stooke’s debut EP is a groundbreaking and experimental
  fusion of warped jazz, glitchy electronics and chamber instrumentation. The
  project as a whole is pitched as a heightened and feverish art piece, drawing
  on Charles’ experiences of loss, disordered eating and struggles with
  addiction, through a sardonic and surrealist lens in which Charles Stooke
  comes across, in his own words, as “a bit of an idiot”.
