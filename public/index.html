These &quot;songs&quot; took shape during the autumn and winter of 2022, a period when Ellie and William lived in South London, amongst the writing and releasing of their second Robbie &amp; Mona album “Tusky”. The collection of tracks explore the absence of sound using field recordings, unusual recording techniques, inaudible frequencies and the sounds between spoken words. William says “conceptually, I envisioned this EP as a soundtrack that would carve out a space of quiet introspection in the listener&#39;s mind—a place where they could contemplate what silence truly meant to them.”</div>

The original mix of ‘Folk’ — a name that alludes to humanity’s ancient nature of obsession is joined by two edits. The first from Black Midi’s DJ Dairy and the second from MM’99.</div>

            <div class="div4 mw7 listDescription">Nasty Cherry emerge out of precious time spent in lockdown recording sessions drenched in melancholia and with a deftly crafted EP &#39;The Movie&#39; in the palms of their hands. Throughout these five self-assured tracks we are led through a shattered house of mirrors where memories of past lovers and senses of self refract and merge. As you stumble out the exit you are left with a lingering sadness for what was but crucially with a sense of re-gained control of narrative and identity.</div>

            <div class="div4 mw7 listDescription">Giant Swan return with their latest EP &#39;Do Not Be Afraid Of Tenderness&#39;, a tempest of cataclysmic beats, shard-like synths and howling yet vulnerable vocals. Reflecting on the projects’ foundations, the Bristol techno duo conjure memories of “sweat, undress and inebriation” and explore a newfound understanding of the power in tenderness, all the while reminding us what we are missing by not hearing music on a fat sound system.</div>
