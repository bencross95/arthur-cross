            <div class="div4 mw7 listDescription">Bringing a heady cocktail of hyperpop, early-2000s R&amp;B, trap and deconstructed club music, Tlya X An&#39;s debut EP TXN is simply united by feeling so damn good. Tlya&#39;s instinctive approach to melody and production mean that every minor detail hits exactly where you want it to, while still feeling starkly new. Each ad lib and synth line hits like a drop of sherbet on your tongue, with her saccharine sense for melody perfectly balanced by a menacing sense of humor.</div>

            <div class="div4 mw7 listDescription">Do you ever imagine yourself passing through hardships, the pressures you put on yourself, structures you have become trapped within and breaking through to a place of calm and wisdom gained? How palpable the excitement within your soul would be even though you have been through so much? Or do you ever wish you could chat to someone who had overcome all of that who would tell you that everything was going to be okay on the other side? It feels not only has Jessie Ware been on this journey but is the person on the other side reaching her hand out to you, with reassurance and abundant joy. A person you want to meet in the smoking area of a club when you are feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of life to guide you through it, get you back on track and bring you once more into the dance! In fact you might even find she put the event on herself so much does she relish in bringing people together to shake off their troubles and feel connected.</div>

            <div class="div4 mw7 listDescription">Grove is a Bristol-based artist, DJ and producer. Their debut EP &#39;Queer + Black&#39; is an exploration of identity, both personal and political - a deft combination of sharp hooks and splintering beats beamed in from a club in 3021 AD. It is a fierce opening statement from an artist that brings a unique energy to their personal experiences of sexuality, society and race, all within the space of 5 exhilarating tracks.</div>

            <div class="div3 listTitle">Sep 29, 2022</div>
            <div class="div4 mw7 listDescription">In Caroline Polachek’s world, we are surrounded by fluidity, systems and artefacts of a modern life imbued with a beauty and rich- ness that represents both the dark and the light in our world. In between these polarities of modern life lies an artist focused on the now, inherently self-aware and deeply philosophical – an artist who is compelled to express the intense emotions in life. Her creations are sewn together by the same gold thread which can be traced through all historic artistic expressions of the human condition. Listening to her music often feels like a heavy weight pressing on your chest suddenly being lifted, or the sharp inhalation of cold air at the top of a mountain just before passing out from oxygen deprivation.</div>

However even with the following she has amassed Sevdaliza remains underrated for the true creative force she is. One could say with some conviction that the music industry and the systems that be have looked to push her as an independent artist to the side. This only caused her to push back and become an artist now known for being fiercely independent from the woes of a gluttonous and exploitative industry as she forged her own path and gave herself her own dues.</div>
