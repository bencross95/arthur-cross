Shifting aliases and formats over the last decade, the artist credits his obsessive, perfectionist tendencies as the force behind his deeply layered compositions. His latest track ‘Folk’ explores the fashion of anonymity and references the 2002 documentary ‘Tokyo Noise’, wherein audience members are seemingly hypnotised and tormented by the intensity of a performance. The original mix of ‘Folk’ — a name that alludes to humanity’s ancient nature of obsession is joined by two edits. The first from Black Midi’s DJ Dairy and the second from MM’99.</div>

One could say with some conviction that the music industry and the systems that be have looked to push her as an independent artist to the side. This only caused her to push back and become an artist now known for being fiercely independent from the woes of a gluttonous and exploitative industry as she forged her own path and gave herself her own dues.</div>

            <div class="div4 mw7 listDescription">(Co-release with Bokeh Versions)

Slithering mutant club scenes flash with the fiercest vocals and 10 tonne bass to explore physicality, tenderness and sexuality. SPICE marks an experimentation of fusing dancehall punk, dub + hip-hop with future-facing dancefloor styles. Born out of the collective mind of some of Bristol&#39;s most twisted artists, Grove drafts in additional production credits from YOKEL (Slack Alice, Avon Terror Corps) and Robin Stewart (Giant Swan).</div>

            <div class="div4 mw7 listDescription">In Caroline Polachek’s world, we are surrounded by fluidity, systems and artefacts of a modern life imbued with a beauty and rich- ness that represents both the dark and the light in our world. In between these polarities of modern life lies an artist focused on the now, inherently self-aware and deeply philosophical – an artist who is compelled to express the intense emotions in life. Her creations are sewn together by the same gold thread which can be traced through all historic artistic expressions of the human condition. Listening to her music often feels like a heavy weight pressing on your chest suddenly being lifted, or the sharp inhalation of cold air at the top of a mountain just before passing out from oxygen deprivation.</div>
