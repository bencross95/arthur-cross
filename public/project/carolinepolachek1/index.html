    <meta name="description" content="In Caroline Polachek’s world, we are surrounded by fluidity, systems and artefacts of a modern life imbued with a beauty and rich- ness that represents both the dark and the light in our world. In between these polarities of modern life lies an artist focused on the now, inherently self-aware and deeply philosophical – an artist who is compelled to express the intense emotions in life. Her creations are sewn together by the same gold thread which can be traced through all historic artistic expressions of the human condition. Listening to her music often feels like a heavy weight pressing on your chest suddenly being lifted, or the sharp inhalation of cold air at the top of a mountain just before passing out from oxygen deprivation.">
