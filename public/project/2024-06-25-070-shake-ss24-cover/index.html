                  <p>070 Shake represents a duality between inner darkness and light, between nature and urban sprawl, lucid thought and hazy dream state, vulnerability and self-assuredness. As an artist and innovator, she represents the deconstruction of harsh binaries and the forging of a new liminal space where expression and acceptance roam free. With her first two albums Modus Vivendi (2020) and You Can’t Kill Me (2022), 070 Shake established herself as one of the world’s rare popular innovators in music, following in the footsteps of genre bending artists before her. Since the release of these two albums, she has collaborated with artists such as Fred Again on Danielle (2022) and on RAYE’s hit single Escapism. (2023) as well as collaborations with Christine and the Queens album on Paranoïa, Angels, True Love (2023). Amongst this output, her singles Black Dress and Natural Habitat started to weave a new thread of creativity for 070 Shake, hinting at an emerging personal project.</p>
