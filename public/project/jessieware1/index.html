                  <p>Do you ever imagine yourself passing through hardships, the pressures you put on yourself, structures you have become trapped within and breaking through to a place of calm and wisdom gained? How palpable the excitement within your soul would be even though you have been through so much?

It feels not only has Jessie Ware been on this journey but is the person on the other side reaching her hand out to you, with reassurance and abundant joy. A person you want to meet in the smoking area of a club when you are feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of life to guide you through it, get you back on track and bring you once more into the dance! In fact you might even find she put the event on herself so much does she relish in bringing people together to shake off their troubles and feel connected.
